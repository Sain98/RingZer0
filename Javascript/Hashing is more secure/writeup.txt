Challenge location : https://ringzer0team.com/challenges/30

It only hints us in telling us that the password is hashed.
if it doesnt give i hint on its location the first place i usually look is the source code.
After scrolling trough the source code just like the previous challenge the login script is in plain view.
The only problem is that the password needed to login is hashed and thus unreadable
Having dealth with hashed passwords before,
i simply used a website that has a large databases of hashes and its corresponding unhashed text/passwords.

Using the unhashed password i was simply able to login

pass: adminz

[code]
			// Look's like weak JavaScript auth script :)
			$(".c_submit").click(function(event) {
				event.preventDefault();
				var p = $("#cpass").val();
				if(Sha1.hash(p) == "b89356ff6151527e89c4f3e3d30c8e6586c63962") {
				    if(document.location.href.indexOf("?p=") == -1) {   
				        document.location = document.location.href + "?p=" + p;
				    }
				} else {
				    $("#cresponse").html("<div class='alert alert-danger'>Wrong password sorry.</div>");
