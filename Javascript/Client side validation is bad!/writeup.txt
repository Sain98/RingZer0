Getting started:
In this challenge the title was a nice giveaway

Since the title said "Client Side" validation i assumed the script would be on the login page itself (client side) or atleast accesible somewhere on the page.
So after quickly scrolling trough the source code from our login page i found a "interesting" script tag right below the login form
in this script it was easy to see that the users where hardcoded in here.
The admin and his password where visible thanks to their script.
However his password was not a normal string it looks like the numbers are simply the ascii codes for the corresponding letters
But since its still a javascript function the builtin console on my Google Chrome webbrowser was able to print out the password
in a readable format quite easy

password = String.fromCharCode(74,97,118,97,83,99,114,105,112,116,73,115,83,101,99,117,114,101)
decoded password = "JavaScriptIsSecure"

The script found in the source code
[code]

		<script>
			// Look's like weak JavaScript auth script :)
			$(".c_submit").click(function(event) {
				event.preventDefault()
				var u = $("#cuser").val();
				var p = $("#cpass").val();
				if(u == "admin" && p == String.fromCharCode(74,97,118,97,83,99,114,105,112,116,73,115,83,101,99,117,114,101)) {
				    if(document.location.href.indexOf("?p=") == -1) {   
				        document.location = document.location.href + "?p=" + p;
				    }
				} else {
				    $("#cresponse").html("<div class='alert alert-danger'>Wrong password sorry.</div>");
				}
			});
		</script>
